"What's up?" I asked.

"Hoot," I was told.

What do I make of this response? What is "hoot," and how must one study it? Is this a question of philosophy, linguistics, etymology, or some communication that escapes analysis?

> There is more meaning and mutual understanding in exchanging a glance with a gorilla than with any other animal I know. 

Alas, it seems that the same is not true of elephants.
